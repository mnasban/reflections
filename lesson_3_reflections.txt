When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when collaborating on projects with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so it wont erase my current work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks is cloning on github, used if you want to change code of others and giving them credit. clone makes a copy of the repository and a remote. branched represents commits.
